These are a few scripts to help creation of a SSL CA and certificates for ClueVPN.

Before starting, edit the sections in openssl-ca.cnf and openssl-req.cnf that are marked with comments.

To initialize the CA, run: ./new_ca.sh
The CA certificate will be placed in ./ca-cert.pem

To create a new certificate and key for a node, run: ./newcert.sh <NodeName>
Respond to the questions that it asks, and make sure that the Common Name you use is the same that you use in the BNL.
It will tell you where it placed the certificate and the key.
